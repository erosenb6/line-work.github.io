        <h1>Dictionary for Building: a Text</h1>
        <h2>in response to Siah Armajani's <span class="italic">Dictionary for Building</span></h2>
        <div id="p-1" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>My father guides me through the city.<br>
                Architect cum docent, he shows me the<br> 
                corners where walls meet and how the sky<br> 
                touches rooftops.
                </p>
        </div>
        <div id="p-2" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>Corners can conceal many sins; he sees<br>
                 the mismatched horizontals before I do. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="p-3" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>We are pointing to ugly vertices when I<br>
                 start calculating compositions. Eaves, <br>
                 dormers, gutters, stucco. A pediment, <br>
                 balustrade, plaster pilaster.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="p-4" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p> Each home proclaims its implicit agreement:<br>
                 each same slatted side, each box and pointed<br>
                  top. Even as kids we were in agreement: a triangle,<br>
                   a square, and you have a crayon house. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="p-5" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>Homes hold treachery—crevices, an open staircase,<br>
             or worse, but hidden. They shelter emptiness, <br>
             vacant rooms, unused tupperwares, moments of <br>
             solitude. Yet they also breathe and billow, and <br>
             they were built with such hope, constructed and <br>
             then cultivated, watered and grown like saplings. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="p-6" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>Inevitably, house-talk turns historical, and my <br>
                father narrates: the imitation-stones convey <br>
                rigidity. The triangle tops are overseas echoes <br>
                of Parthenons, ancient victory. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="p-7" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>Siah sculpts a single chair in miniature, <br>
                which stands alone. Alone except the checkered <br>
                tile floor—does this make a home? 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="p-8" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>Siah sees the fragments and their quiet composition. <br>
                I want to write books like building, accidentally,<br>
                 but of course. Ones that sit in foundations who remain <br>
                 long past their roofs. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="p-9" class="ui-widget-content">
            <p>My dad has a tendency to pause. I don’t notice <br>
                until he’s missing from my side; I look back <br>
                there he is: crouched by a building, taking a photo. <br>
                I grew up with this alternately egregious and endearing<br>
                 habit. At 22, I discover fragments of buildings <br>
                 catch my attention just the same. We end back where <br>
                 we started, my father and me side-by-side.
